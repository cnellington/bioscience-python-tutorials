# BIOSCIENCE PYTHON TUTORIALS

## Setup

These tutorials require a select few tools to demonstrate how easy it
is to begin working on advanced computing applications:
- Python 3.6+
- Jupyter Notebook OR Jupyter Labs

If you need to install these tools, follow these tutorials:
- Python: https://www.codecademy.com/articles/install-python3
- Jupyter Notebook: https://jupyter.org/install

Once finished, run the following commands to check for correct installation:
```
python -V
```
You should see a python version 3.6 or above
```
jupyter notebook -V
```
You should see any reasonable version number (this was made with version 6.0.3).

Once you have the tools, clone this repository using
````
git clone https://github.com/cnellington/bioscience-python-tutorials.git
````
Each tutorial takes around 60 minutes to complete. Start with whichever one interests you the most!
