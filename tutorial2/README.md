# Artificial Neural Network Simulations
### Bioscience Python Tutorial #2

In this tutorial, we will explore how to model the complex 
interactions within the brain. Computational models of 
neurons have paved the way for various styles of neural
networks, enabling researchers to create powerful learning
systems. From image recognition to predictive models,
neural networks function as important tools for finding
meaning in complex data.

This tutorial will investigate spiking neural networks,
which aim to use refined models of neuron behavior to 
analyze how neurons interact and change in different
conditions. These networks are especially important for
neuroscience research, as it allows for testing of 
experimental paradigms without requiring living organisms
as models.

Begin with ```brian2_intro``` to gain some familiarity with the Brian2 library.
Then, try running through ```neuron_sim```, the solutions for this code can be found in ```neuron_sim_sol```.
